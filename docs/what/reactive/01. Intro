Reactive UI frameworks center around the idea of reacting to changes in data. Here's a breakdown of what defines them and their core idea.

Core Idea:
==========

Data-Driven Updates:
--------------------

The fundamental principle is that the user interface (UI) automatically updates itself in response to changes in the underlying data. Instead of manually updating the UI, you define how the UI should react to data changes.

Think of it like a spreadsheet: if you change a value in one cell, any other cells that depend on that value automatically update.

Many reactive UI frameworks are inspired by or utilize reactive programming principles. This paradigm deals with asynchronous data streams and the propagation of change.

It allows you to express complex interactions and data flows in a clear and concise way.

Declarative UI:
---------------

Reactive frameworks often encourage a declarative approach to UI development. This means you describe what the UI should look like based on the data, rather than how to update it step-by-step.

Data Binding:
-------------

A key feature is robust data binding, which establishes a connection between the data and the UI elements. When the data changes, the UI automatically reflects those changes.

Asynchronous Operations
-----------------------

Reactive frameworks are well-suited for handling asynchronous operations, such as network requests or user input. They provide mechanisms to manage and react to these events efficiently.

State Management
----------------

They often provide tools and patterns for managing application state, making it easier to maintain consistency and predictability in the UI.
