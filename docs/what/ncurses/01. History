The story of ncurses is rooted in the need for a portable and standardized way to control text-based terminals. Here's a breakdown of its origins:

Early Days and Termcap/Terminfo:

In the early days of Unix, different terminals had different control codes for tasks like moving the cursor, clearing the screen, and changing text attributes.
To address this, the termcap (terminal capabilities) library was created. It provided a database of terminal capabilities, allowing programs to adapt to different terminals.
Later, terminfo was developed as a more powerful and efficient replacement for termcap. Terminfo used a compiled database, making it faster and more flexible.
curses: The Predecessor:

The curses (cursor optimization) library was developed at the University of California, Berkeley, as part of the BSD Unix distribution.
curses provided a higher-level interface for manipulating the terminal screen, abstracting away the complexities of termcap/terminfo.
It allowed developers to treat the terminal as a screen of characters, with functions for moving the cursor, drawing text, and handling input.
ncurses: The GNU Implementation:

As the GNU project gained momentum, there was a need for a free and portable implementation of curses.
ncurses (new curses) was created by Zeyd M. Ben-Halim with improvements, and later by Eric S. Raymond, as a free software replacement for the original BSD curses.
The "n" in ncurses stands for "new," indicating that it was a reimplementation and enhancement of the original curses library.
ncurses was designed to be more portable and compliant with the Single UNIX Specification (SUS).
It also addressed some limitations of the original curses, such as better support for different character sets and terminal capabilities.
Why the Name "curses"?

The name "curses" itself refers to the library's ability to control the cursor and optimize screen updates.
It's a bit of an odd name, and there's no evidence of a specific, deeper meaning behind it. It simply became the accepted name for that type of terminal screen manipulation library.
The name ncurses, just adds the N for new, to show that it was a new implementation.
In essence, ncurses is a testament to the evolution of Unix and the need for portable terminal control. It provides a powerful and widely used foundation for creating text-based user interfaces.
