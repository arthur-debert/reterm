UIs make testing and automation much harder than shell commands or apis. 

reterm provide facilities for bridging the gap and giving you simple ways to do programatically interaction and testing. 

retems exposes for any given app, ways to

1. On the query side, to query
    - State
    - UI tree
    - Layout, sizing and position
    - Render props and status

2. On the control side: 
    - Generate sinthetic events for keyboard
    - Generate virtual screen sizes
    - Generate data update events
    - Control cursor position

All of these are available in two different  waysL: 

* API: with an App instance, the api will give you programatical control. useful for automatic interaction and user testing.
* Command line: will communicate with the app through a bi directional socket allowing you to send and get information back. Useful for integration, visual and end2end testing.

API
----

Most functions are regular parts of the component api,  like listing children, state, label and property.

The control package has functions to generate synthetic events, screens , data updates and cursor pos for any app or component in the tree.
