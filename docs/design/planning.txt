reterm UI Framework Implementation Plan
---------------------------------------

1. Terminology Standardization

To ensure consistency throughout the framework, we will standardize on the
following terminology:

- Events: The primary term for all notifications within the system. We will
  avoid using "signals" to prevent confusion.
- Event Handlers: Functions that respond to events.
- Event Emission: The process of generating and dispatching events.
- Event Propagation: The process of events moving through the component
  hierarchy.

2. Implementation Sequencing

The implementation is divided into three phases: Minimal, Enhanced, and Full.
This allows for incremental development and early validation of core
concepts.

Phase 1: Minimal Viable Framework

    Core Component System:
    - Base Component class with lifecycle methods
    - Container class for component hierarchy
    - Simple event propagation
    - Basic state management

    Basic Layout Engine:
    - Vertical and horizontal layouts (VBox, HBox)
    - Min/max size constraints
    - Simple expansion rules

    Essential UI Components:
    - Window (top-level container)
    - Button
    - TextInput
    - Label

    Event System:
    - Event registration and emission
    - Basic event handlers
    - Key event normalization

    Integration with ncurses:
    - Window management
    - Basic rendering
    - Input handling

Notes: 
 crete cons files for key codes, events names, colors, etc
 we should have a usable logging, set to debug from the first moment

 test live in  "tests" and are to use pytest with pure functions
 
Phase 2: Enhanced Features

    Advanced Components:
    - Table
    - Dialog
    - Menu
    - StatusBar
    - ProgressBar
    - Checkbox/Radio buttons

    Improved Layout:
    - Weighted expansion
    - Nested layouts
    - Scrollable containers

    State Management:
    - Application state store
    - Reactive bindings
    - State persistence

    Theming System:
    - Color definitions
    - Style inheritance
    - Theme switching

    Enhanced Event Handling:
    - Event filtering
    - Custom events
    - Event transformation

    Developer Tools:
    - Basic logging
    - Simple debugging aids
    - Error reporting

Phase 3: Full Framework

    Advanced UI Components:
    - Tree view
    - Tabs
    - Rich text display
    - Charts/graphs
    - Custom component creation

    Advanced Layout:
    - Grid layout
    - Responsive layouts
    - Complex constraints

    Template System:
    - Component templates
    - Variable substitution
    - Template inheritance

    Comprehensive Developer Tools:
    - Visual debugging
    - State inspection
    - Performance profiling
    - Testing utilities

    Rendering Engine:
    - Multiple output formats (terminal, HTML, plain text)
    - Custom renderers
    - Layout visualization

    Advanced Features:
    - Accessibility support
    - Internationalization
    - Animation/transitions
    - Drag and drop

3. Implementation Recommendations

    1. Start with Core Architecture:
        a. Begin with the fundamental component system and event handling
        b. Establish a solid foundation before adding more complex features
        c. Focus on the integration with ncurses early to validate the
           approach

    2. Iterative Development:
        a. Implement features in small, testable increments
        b. Create working examples for each feature to validate the design
        c. Get early feedback on the API design and developer experience

    3. Focus on Developer Experience:
        a. Prioritize clear error messages and debugging tools
        b. Develop comprehensive documentation alongside the code
        c. Create tutorials and examples for common use cases

    4. Testing Strategy:
        a. Implement automated tests from the beginning
        b. Create visual test cases for UI components
        c. Develop a test framework that simulates user interactions

    5. Documentation:
        a. Document design decisions and rationales
        b. Provide clear API references
        c. Include visual examples and diagrams
        d. Address common pitfalls and gotchas

4. Implementation Sequence Diagram

(Note: Mermaid diagrams are not supported in plain text. The diagram is
omitted here but was included in the previous markdown version.)

This implementation plan allows for incremental development and early
validation of the core concepts while providing a clear path to a
full-featured framework. Each phase builds on the previous one, ensuring
that the foundation is solid before adding more complex features.
